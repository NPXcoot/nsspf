# Not So Simple Plants and Fungi

(copied from the [forum post](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=16345))

A mod that adds wild plants and fungi in order to give another source of food without farming.

For now there are only 29 fungi and no plants.

You just have to walk around in the different biomes and gather the fungi.

All the fungi are taken from the real world and thay have their scientific names. Many of them are good to eat, but others can be lethal.

There are 5 types of fungi:

* Ectomycorrhizal fungi: grows in association with the roots of trees, the mycelium grows in the ground and sometimes a mushroom will grow.
* There are also truffles, hard to find (truffles are produced underground)
* Saprobiontic fungi: divided in 4 categories distiguished by where they grow
    * Jungle fungi grow on trees trunks in the jungle.
    * Grass fungi grow as mycelium underground in grassland and sometimes produce a mushroom on the surface.
    * Snowbank fungi act as grass fungi but under the snow.
    * Tree fungi as jungle fungi grow on trees trunks of trees and pine trees.

The mushrooms:

Fungi are generated by ABM, so their growth will require some time.

It is possible to farm the fungi with the spores. Exposed to air mycelium will die and the dirt left may contain spores, dropped when digged.

For saprobiontic is necessary to click with the spores the ground (`dirt_with_grass` or `dirt_with_snow`) to grow a new mycelium under the node. Ectomycorrhizal fungi spores need to placed on the bottom of the right trunk of a tree, each fungus need a specific tree.

Many mushrooms are hard to digest so it is better to cook them before eating, in order to appreciate their nutritional value fully. Cooking could also inactivate the toxin in poisonous fungi (only in some of them obviously!). In other cases cooking may damage the beneficial propreties of the mushrooms reducing their nutritional value.
